# WonderSwan Karnak mapper Test V0.1.0 (20250601)

This is a Karnak mapper test program for Bandai WonderSwan (Color/Crystal) & Benesse PocketChallenge V2.

## How to use

Load the ROM in an emulator or flash it to a flashcart and put it in your WonderSwan.
The program will go through all the tests and then write "Ok".
You use the X1-X4 to navigate the menus, A to select an option, B to go back.

## Building

I use nasm <https://nasm.us/> by running "nasm -f bin -o KarnakTest.bfb KarnakTest.asm".

## Controls

Use WS X1-X4 to navigate the menus. A to select/continue failed test, B to go back/skip failed test.
